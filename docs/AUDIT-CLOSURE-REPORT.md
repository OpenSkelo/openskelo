Last updated: 2026-02-18
Branch: `feature/block-core-mvp`

## Executive Summary
The independent audit remediation plan has been driven to checklist closure on this branch.

- Security lane: closed with fail-closed posture and regression coverage
- Provider lane: implemented OpenClaw + Ollama + OpenAI-compatible, plus streaming/params baselines
- Cleanup/validation lane: legacy hard-cut, diagnostics improvements, and operability hardening completed

## Verification
- Build: `npm run build` ✅
- Tests: `npm test` ✅
- Checklist status: no open `[ ]` entries in `AUDIT-CLOSURE-CHECKLIST.md`

## Key Artifacts
- Checklist: `AUDIT-CLOSURE-CHECKLIST.md`
- Claim alignment: `docs/CLAIM-ALIGNMENT.md`
- Scope decisions: `docs/DESIGN-SCOPE.md`
- 60s demo: `docs/DEMO-60S.md`

## Remaining Work Type
Remaining effort is now product evolution/next roadmap (not unresolved audit checklist debt).
